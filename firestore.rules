/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Microgame Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data (profiles, history, challenges)
 * and provides public read access to global microgame data. The rules are designed to prevent unauthorized
 * data access and modification while allowing for flexible data shapes during the prototyping phase.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/userProfiles/{userProfileId}: User profile data, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/playHistory/{playHistoryId}: User's game play history, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/dailyChallenges/{dailyChallengeId}: User's daily challenges, owned by the user.
 * - /microgames/{microgameId}: Publicly accessible microgame data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly segregated under the /users/{userId} path, enforcing path-based ownership.
 * - Microgame data is publicly readable, but write access is not permitted in this prototype.
 * - List operations are generally allowed for user-owned data, enabling clients to list their own resources.
 * - The ruleset avoids `get()` calls for authorization, relying on path-based checks for efficiency.
