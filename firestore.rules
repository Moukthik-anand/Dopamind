/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data while allowing public read access to microgame data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/playHistory/{playHistoryId}: Stores play history, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/dailyChallenges/{dailyChallengeId}: Stores daily challenges, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /microgames/{microgameId}: Stores microgame information, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly segregated and accessible only to the authenticated user.
 * - Microgame data is publicly readable, but write access is not granted in this initial prototype.
 * - The rules avoid costly `get()` calls by relying on path-based ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User ownership is enforced by matching the `userId` parameter in the path to the authenticated user's `uid`.
