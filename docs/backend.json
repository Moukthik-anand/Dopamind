    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to address the 'auth/operation-not-allowed' error, which typically indicates that Firebase Authentication methods are not enabled in the Firebase Console. While the database structure doesn't directly fix this, it ensures a scalable and secure data model that can support various authentication scenarios after enabling the necessary methods (like Google Sign-In). It focuses on Authorization Independence, enabling clear and debuggable security rules. This is achieved by using path-based ownership for user-specific data and avoiding `get()` calls in security rules. Each collection is designed to have a homogeneous security posture, simplifying rules.\n\nUser profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}/userProfile` for path-based ownership. Microgames are stored in the `/microgames` collection. This design facilitates QAPs by enabling secure `list` operations based on the user's `userId` without relying on complex filtering in rules."
